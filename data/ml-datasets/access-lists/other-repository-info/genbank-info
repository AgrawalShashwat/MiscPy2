Notes: Weekly update files are available as standard ASCII files or
       as compressed ASCII files.  The compressed files are about
       one-third the size of the standard files.  They can be
       distinguished by the .Z suffix and can be uncompressed after
       transfer with the standard Unix uncompress utility.

       In addition to the weekly (incremental) update files, the
       newdata directories each contain a file which represents the
       cumulative contents of the (GenBank, GenPept, or EMBL) new data
       since the last (quarterly) public release, pruned of duplicate
       entries.  A given weekly update file will not contain duplicate
       instances of an entry, but a given entry may appear (with 
       changed status) in more than one of the weekly update files.
       Within a cumulative update file (gbseq.all, gpseq.all, or
       emseq.all) there should be no duplicate entries.  The cumulative
       update files are updated daily and are available in compressed
       form only.

       The current GenBank release files (in gb-rel63) and
       GenPept release files (in gp-rel63) are provided
       in compressed form only.
