	Schedworld is a machine shop scheduling domain. There are several 
machines in the shop, corresponding to several actions in the domain.  Each
machine can operate an object at a time, only if the machine is IDLE and the
object is FREE.  We would like to perform some of the above operations in an
object. But there are some restrictions in the time at which we can use a
machine. For example, ROLLing an object makes the object hot, and since some
machines will not handle hot objects we would have to wait for some time to
schedule a machine for a hot object. PRODIGY has to find an acceptable
sequence of machines to perform the required operations in an object. 

	Each operator corresponds to a machine, i.e. an operation to be 
performed on the object. These are the following: POLISH, ROLL, LATHE, 
GRIND, PUNCH, BOLT, WELD, SPRAY-PAINT and IMMERSION-PAINT. Some of these
machines can CLAMP the object.


	The interesting features of this domain are: 

   - there is a lot of goal interactions.

   - this is the only domain in Prodigy where time is involved.

   - this domain has been extensively tested with the EBL module.
