	In the blocksworld domain an arm picks blocks and stacks them.
The arm can only hold one block.

	This is a very simple domain. There is no functions file.

	There are several directories related to this domain:

  - blocksworld: the domain as was built initially.

  - frozenblocksworld: a stable version. Used for the manual.

  - extended-bw: an extension to blocksworld that deals with  the weight 
	         and location of the blocks.



	The domain gridworld is a version of blocksworld in 3-D.
