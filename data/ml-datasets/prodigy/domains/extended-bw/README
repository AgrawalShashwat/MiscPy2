Extended Blocks World - rlj 4/88

Objects
-------
 (object <name>)
 (block <name>)
 (pyramid <name>)
 (weight <object> <amount>)
 (location <object> <position>)
 (vacant-loc <position>)
 (adjacent-loc <pos1> <pos2>) function that tells if a location is 
     adjacent or not
 (weight <object> <amount>)

Description
-----------
An extension of the standard blocks world domain.  The operators are:
 + PICK-UP - standard except there is a weight limit on objects pick-up
 + PUT-DOWN - standard
 + STACK  - standard
 + UNSTACK - standard except there is a weight limit for unstacking 
 + PUSH-OBJECT - objects that are to heavy to be picked up can be pushed
 + TOPPLE - the robot arm can push the top object off stacked blocks
 + GLUE - two blocks can be made into one.  The new object has the combined
      weight

This domain is a test domain to get a feel for how prodigy works
 + adds weight to blocks
 + adds location to objects in a grid array on the table top
 + has more control rules than the blocks world
 
Operation
---------
*XDIM*, *YDIM* defines the x and y size of the table top
