	This is an extension to the original STRIPS domain.
The rooms have doors that can be open or closed, locked or unlocked.
There are keys for the locks.

	In this domains it is often the case that there are several 
different ways of achieving the same goal.  Also, the problems in this
domain can be made arbitrarily hard (or even unfeasible) depending on the
start state.  One of the parameters that can be manipulated in the initial
state is what keys does the robot have.
         
        This domain can be used in conjunction with the EBL module,
 and it has been extensively tested.
