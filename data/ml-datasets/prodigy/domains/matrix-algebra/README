{\bf\large PRODIGY domain - ALGEBRAWORLD\\
January 29, 1989}
\end{center}

\begin{itemize}

\item The final purpose of this domain is to define a large set of 
matrix operations for solving simple linear algebra problems within PRODIGY.

\item This domain is being used for studying the process of learning
how to solve a new problem by derivational analogy with previously solved 
problems.

\item The initial state is always a matrix. The goal statement specifies
desired final configurations of the matrix. The generated plan enumerates 
the operations to apply to the initial matrix that lead into the goal
matrix.

\item The current status of the domain allow simple operations as 
scaling a matrix, multiplying a row by a constant, etc. With the actual
domain, PRODIGY is able to compute an upper triangular matrix from
an initial matrix representing a linear system of equations.

\item The design of this domain involved dealing with the following issues:

\begin{itemize}
\item Identifying and separating the operations on matrices
from their algorithmic sequencing in linear algebra procedures.

\item Exploring the use of the universal quantifier in specifying
the preconditions of the operators. In particular we focused on the
need for having ``generator'' predicates, the problems with updating
the values of the arguments of a predicate used in a ``forall'' statement
in subgoaling, and the previous issues within embebbed ``forall''
predicates.
\end{itemize}

\item Finally this domain is also being used as a test domain 
for interleaving goals in the search tree.
