;; R1 domain                                      (Wed 27 Apr 1988)
;;
;;
;; This domain is a model of the VAX UNIBUS configuration task performed by 
;; John McDermott's R1 program.  The task involves placing a set of 
;; peripheral device boards (modules) into backplanes (slots holding boards)
;; and then placing the backplanes inside boxes.  Placing boards in backplanes
;; is constrained by power, space, pinning type, and UNIBUS load.  Placing 
;; backplanes in boxes is constrained by power, UNIBUS length, space, and 
;; cabling.
;;
;; Features:
;;
;; 	o  DSPF: The define static predicate functions facility was
;; 	   created for this domain.  It increases the speed prodigy
;;	   by  about 37%.  Be sure to toggle this flag before loading
;; 	   a problem. 
;;
;;      o  This domain is a prodigy version of the R1-Soar
;;	   domain.  As such, it resembles the R1-Soar configuration 
;; 	   task, but whereas Soar performs the task linearly--specifying
;;	   what the next item to configure will be--Prodigy can select
;; 	   items at random.
;;
;;
;;	o  Objects: backplane (bp) -- a physical object with slots to hold
;;				      circuit boards, there are 4 varieties
;;    	            		      of modules.
;;
;;     	            module  (mod)  -- a collection of circuit boards, there
;;				      are currently 7 kinds of modules.
;;    	            
;;    	            boards         -- a circuit board.
;;    	            
;;    	            cable	   -- a power cable connecting backplanes,
;; 				      these are needed to provide sufficient
;;				      electricity to the boards when they are
;;				      inside the backplanes, there are 2 kinds
;;				      of cables. 
;;					
;;		    box            -- the container for backplane-board 
;; 				      configurations. there is only one type
;;				      of box (a standard box).
