@heading("Domain: Constructing telescope mirrors")

@center[(jgc & yg)]

@section(Description)

The operators in the domain describe how to make a primary telescope mirror.

Objects: 

@begin(itemize)

Pieces of wood and glass. 

They can be planaror concave, clean or dirty.

@end(itemize)

Actions:

@begin(itemize)

To clean a solid surface with distilled water.

To grind a surface with a certain shape with the grinding equipment.

To aluminize a surface (by depositing vaporized aluminum on the surface in a 
vacuum chamber).

To polish the surface and make it smooth.

@end(itemize)


Rules:

@begin(itemize)
A mirror is a polished and aluminized surface of glass.

A primary telescope mirror is a mirror with a concave shape.

@end(itemize)

@section(About the Domain)


@begin(itemize)

The domain was designed to build and test the learning by 
experimentation module.

@begin(multiple)
Two versions of the domain:

1) The domain completely described. The operators are written in full, 
with all the preconditions and postconditions.

2) The incomplete domain: the operators are missing preconditions and/or 
postconditions. Control rules are needed.

@end(multiple)

The actions are irreversible. Unlike other domains (for example blocksworld),
there is no operator that does the reverse action of a given one.

@end(itemize)
